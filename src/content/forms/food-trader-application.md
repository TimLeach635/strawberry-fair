Food pitches are not allocated on a first come first served basis, as we have a limited number of food pitches available. To ensure we can offer a variety of cuisines to visitors of the Fair, we will consider all of the applications we have received in early spring and make pitch offers to traders at that point.

If you have any questions about selling food or non-alcoholic drinks at Strawberry Fair, please see [Trader FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VK62GAmE1bzmHqwnoVzksYNBo0hmcGAaqFn3pZUGEgY/edit?usp=sharing) or email <mailto:traders@strawberry-fair.org.uk> if you can't find the answer.
